                    In Lilac we provide two ways to connect with your chat partners. The more secure way is for both users to initiate chat requests for a connection to be established. For example, if Alice and Bob want to connect in this way, Alice sends a request to connect with Bob, AND Bob sends a request to connect with Alice. To operate in this mode, the box should be unchecked.
                    The simpler way would be for only one user to initiate a request, i.e. Alice sends a request to connect with Bob, OR Bob sends a request to connect with Alice. The recipient of the request would then have to accept for a connection to be established. To connect in this way, the box should be checked.

                    SMP stands for the Socialist Millionaire's Protocol. It is a cryptographic protocol and we use it in Lilac to allow two parties to securely verify each others identity through the use of a shared secret. We recommend you initiate SMP with all your chat partners, as it provides a convenient means to ensure you are actually communicating with the right person, and not someone else who may have logged in with the same username. SMP also acts as a defense against man-in-the-middle attacks

							Lilac: architecture for lightweight, low latency, anonymous communication.
							Our primary aim is to design and implement a system which is simultaneously secure, anonymous, easy to use, and deployable. There are four different types of components which make up Lilac. The first is the directory server, which monitors changes in the	network topology, and maintains information about active relays and presence servers in the network. The directory server also hosts the Lilac website, and therefore delivers content (like this page) to clients (like you). The second is the Presence Server, which maintains information about online users and is the intermediary responsible for connecting two users who wish to communicate. The third are the relays which provide anonymity to the system as per the Onion Routing (OR) model. And finally, the fourth element are the clients, who are the end users of the system.

					<p class="text-justify">The Directory Server is a trusted server which manages the information required for Lilac
					to operate as a system. That is, the Directory Server maintains information about the Lilac
					relays and presence servers. When one of these servers come online, they must first register
					themselves with the directory server and provide their IP address, public key and function
					(relay or presence server). The directory server is then able to compile the collection of
					online relays and presence servers, and update this collection as servers come online and go
					online. The architecture of Lilac allows for a single presence server, and so the Directory
					Server operates on a first come-first server basis, with the first presence server to register
					itself being Presence Server for the system, and any following servers which register become
					backups in case the primary server goes down. In the case where no presence servers are
					available in the system, the Directory Server itself can undertake the role.</p>
					<p>The Directory Server also performs the function of serving content to Lilac's clients. A
					user wishing to use Lilac will simply enter the domain name of the Directory Server into a
					modern web browser. The Directory Server will then serve pages which make up the Lilac
					user interface (UI) and the client-side program logic, as well as the details of the presence
					server and set of relays which are known to be online.</p>
					<p>The implementation of Lilac as a web application; requiring no additional software requirements
					on the client's part (other than a modern web browser) is a step in the direction
					towards user-friendliness and usability. We believe this design decision will make the average
					user more receptive to using our system, as opposed to requiring them to download and
					install additional, unknown software to their personal computer.</p>

                   <p class="text-justify"> Relays are volunteer-based servers which perform the same functionality in Lilac as the
					relays do in <a href="https://thetorproject.org" target="_blank">Tor</a> anonymizing traffic. Relays in Lilac, unlike Tor, exclusively handle
					textual traffic related to chat. Because this traffic is lightweight, we do not need to be overly
					concerned with the bandwidth of our relays. As such, we may choose three relays (from the
					list provided by the Directory Server) completely randomly for our circuit. This eliminates
					any bias which malicious relays might attempt to exploit to get more traffic coming their
					way.</p>
					Once the relays have been selected by the client, a circuit needs to be created and symmetric
					<p class="text-justify">keys need to be established with each relay. The first step is to create a symmetric key
					with the guard (first) relay. Lilac implements the <a href="https://www.infsec.cs.uni-saarland.de/~mohammadi/paper/owake.pdf" target="_blank">ACE Protocol </a>  which is an adaptation of
					the Diffie Hellman key exchange algorithm and provides one-way key authentication, as well
					as operational effciency compared with the other proposed protocols. Upon establishing
					a symmetric key with the guard relay, the client can use this key to privately communicate
					the IP address of the next relay in the circuit. The client can then establish a symmetric
					key with the second relay using the ACE Protocol, via the guard relay. The same process is
					repeated to extend the circuit to the exit (third) relay and generate a symmetric key with
					it, and then repeated one last time for the presence server. This process is the first action
					taken at the client side. During this circuit build time, a loading screen is displayed on the
					client's web browser. Once the circuit has been established and extended to the presence
					server, the client is able to use the system and is prompted to enter her username.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Cover traffic involves inserting dummy messages into the system to increase the anonymity
					provided. Implementing cover traffic first requires the selection of an interval time, known
					as the heartbeat interval. This interval could be different for every node in the network.
					The default in Lilac is 300 milliseconds. Once it has been selected, the method for sending
					outbound messages needs to be adjusted. Rather than sending outbound messages immediately,
					they are queued, with a separate queue being kept for each outbound connection.
					After the passing of a heartbeat interval (for example, after every 300 milliseconds) the node
					removes the first message from every queue and sends it to the respective recipient. If a
					queue is empty, the node generates a dummy message and sends it to along the queue's
					corresponding connection. Note that the term node here refers to clients, relays and the
					Presence Server. The implementation of cover traffc is useful in protected the system from
					statistical analysis of its traffic flow. However, selecting the heartbeat interval involves
					a trade-off. Selecting a very short interval increases congestion in the network, whereas
					selecting a longer interval increases the latency experienced by the users, as messages may
					be queued for this length of time at each relay.</p>
